Would you use setValue or use childByAutoId followed by updateChildValues? (And why?) Once you've explained why, code it! To help you out, let's say that your post object only stores 2 pieces of information: (1) postDescription which is equal to "Firebase is dope af", (2) posterName which is equal to the username of the current user.
